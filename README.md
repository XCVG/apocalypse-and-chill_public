## Introduction

See Who I Am is a visual novel that explores transgender themes against the backdrop of the magical girl genre. It is a relatively short game with really janky art, but it was made in a month with limited time available to work on it. It might be exactly the story you expect, or it might be something completely different.

At the very least, I can finally say I've finished a visual novel.

## Storyline

Steve is a regular young guy, struggling through his first year of college, with the biggest decision on his mind whether to finish watching a film for class or to play some video games and fake his way through the assignment. But when monsters and then magical girls come crashing through the walls, he'll have to face revelations that will change everything.

## Gameplay

This is a visual novel, which can be interacted with using the mouse (by clicking on buttons) or keyboard (by selecting with the arrow keys and confirming with the enter key). An in-game menu can be opened with the Esc key.
