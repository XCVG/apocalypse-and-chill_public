This is a categorically transgender narrative. If you object to that for some reason, close the game and delete it from your computer.

Although this is (hopefully) an ultimately positive story, it contains depictions of dysphoria, dissociation, and depression, brief mentions of self-harm and suicide, misgendering and mild transphobia from some characters, and a lot of strong language.
